IdeaCrew, Inc. is an innovative, full-service technology consulting group that has helped both public and private organizations to become more customer-focused and transparent. Since 2002, IdeaCrew has been developing and operating robust and sustainable solutions that leverage the power of data and advanced open source and cloud computing technology.

With decades of combined experience in information technology, community resources and consulting, the IdeaCrew team offers a depth of expertise in our industry that distinguishes us from others in the field.

The IdeaCrew team includes over fifty (50) experts in IT strategy, enterprise architecture, GIS, system design, Web development, Big Data, business analysis, business intelligence, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies, software development and testing, cloud infrastructure architecture and operations, disaster recovery, continuity of operations, clinical and administrative health care subject matter experts, data scientists and statisticians.

IdeaCrew services include:

- Management consulting
- Technology strategic planning
- Architecture design
- System integration
- Software development
- Cloud infrastructure design and operation
- Data analytics, reporting and visualization

Combined, these disciplines produce synergy and deliver exceptional value to our clients.  For example, IdeaCrew has been helping the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority to operate one of our nation&#39;s most successful Health Benefit Exchanges. In only seven months, the IdeaCrew team stabilized struggling legacy applications, while building a sustainable replacement core mission system that enables customers to quickly and simply complete benefit enrollment. The hybrid cloud hosting solution designed and operated by IdeaCrew for the DC Health Benefit Exchange Authority was recently named winner – Best Practices - of the 2016 Amazon Web Services City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge.

In the public sector, IdeaCrew helped our nation&#39;s capital, Washington, DC, reduce crime and improve city services by developing technology and instituting processes that: 1) collect real-time data from dozens of agencies; 2) analyze and assemble that data into actionable information; and 3) present citywide actionable information to leaders in various forms: alerts, dashboards, briefings, maps and reports.

One of the most pervasive challenges to IT project development is uncertainty. IdeaCrew applies Agile development methodologies and Lean principles to address this issue:

- See the whole
- Build integrity in
- Respond to change
- Iterative and incremental development
- Always on/always improving

IdeaCrew goes beyond just implementing technology — we create customized solutions to meet our clients&#39; unique needs. Each member of our team is wholly committed to providing our stakeholders with an exceptional customer experience. We ask questions, we collaborate and most importantly, we **listen** to our clients. At IdeaCrew, we don&#39;t believe in limiting our clients&#39; options — we aren&#39;t &quot;OR&quot; people — we pride ourselves on being **&quot;AND&quot;** people.

These cardinal tenants, in concert with IdeaCrew&#39;s business-centered, Agile development methods, reduce risk and result in predictable technology solution deliverables, costs and timeframes.
